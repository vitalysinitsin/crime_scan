[DEMO](https://hungryvito.github.io/crime_scan/)

Crime Scan is my take on the default map that local police departments provide. With this project, I want to improve and add more visualization tools to get a clearer idea of the crime-level situation in the area. Two use cases I want to enhance the visualization on:

1. The markers based by type overlap, resulting in less violent crime covering everything else (e.g. car theft type overlaps violent crime types).
2. The markers of the only type displayed overlap each other, making it harder to figure out the level of crime density in the neighborhood.

*DISCLAIMER* 

At the moment the demo shows the static data I simulated based on the [Toronto Police's Major Crime Indicators API](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::major-crime-indicators-open-data/about). 
The initial plan is to integrate the API with a year of data, division grouping and crime type markers.
